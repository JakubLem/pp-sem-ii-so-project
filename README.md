# pp-sem-ii-so-project

A console game where the user can enter a few words when invoking a command or enter them while running a script. At the end the game will write how many points the user will have and at the end he will be able to view the points in the results table stored in the ```results.txt``` file.  


### Dictonary file
The current version of the dictionary is in the ```data.txt``` file, not in ```/usr/share/dict/words```  
You can locally try to replace the input file on line 41 - just uncomment it (https://github.com/JakubLem/pp-sem-ii-so-project/blob/main/scrabble.sh#L41)

### Run script

```bash scrabble.sh [words]```  

Help:  
```bash scrabble.sh -h```  


### Developer settings

debug variable is located in https://github.com/JakubLem/pp-sem-ii-so-project/blob/main/scrabble.sh#L182
With debug mode you can see more info when script is running.
